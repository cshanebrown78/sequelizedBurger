# burger

## Overview

This is an App using node express handlebars and mysql database.  It's called Eat-Da-Burger.  It is the 14th assignment for my bootcamp class.  The app has a user enter a type of hamburger and in the left column it will display the burger and it's index.  The user can then click the 'Devour It' button and it will move the burger to the right side and change the devour value in the database to true.

## Steps to complete in order to use App through node

1. Clone repository
